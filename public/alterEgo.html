            <h2>Not A Mechanic Betty</h2>
        </div>
            <p>My name is Not a Mechanic Betty, I have been creating YouTube videos for over three years now. I have over 400 videos posted. The topic of my chanel is helping people understand that they are strong and they can do things that they may not have realized they were capable of. My motto is "If I can do it, so can you!" I teach people how to do basic car and motorcycle repair work among other things like replacing the bathtub drain, cooking, cleaning etc. I have over 6000 subscribers and my videos have over 2 million views.</p>
